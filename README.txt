One you have the Surmount table working on your computer to insure that all of
the properties are installed correctly.

First the user names testuser1, testuser2, and testuser3 are provided for you to
play around with to make sure that a file that is saved for each user is
avaiable and can be viewed.  The passwords for these users are group4test1,
group4test2, and group4test3 respectively.

To insure that it is working correctly we suggest that you log in as each of
these users enter some test data and save tables for other users then log on as
those other users to make sure that they are reloading correctly.

The propertie that this will test is the ability for one use to share a spread
sheet with another user.  Independently all modules were unit tested however,
for security many of the methods were returned to private methods.
